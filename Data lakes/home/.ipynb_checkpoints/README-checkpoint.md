# Project: Data Lake

## Introduction

Startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In order to enable Sparkify to parse and analyze their data in a distributed manner, a Spark ETL Pipeline was created, which reads the data stored inside S3.

## How to run

To start the ETL pipeline, you have to run the following file below:

To fill tables via ETL:
```bash
python3 etl.py
```

## Project structure

- dl.cfg: File with AWS credentials.
- etl.py: Program that extracts songs and log data from S3, transforms it using Spark, and loads the dimensional tables created in parquet format back to S3.
- README.md: Current file, contains detailed information about the project.

## ETL pipeline

1. Load credentials
2. Read data from S3
    - Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
    - Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

    The script reads song_data and load_data from S3.

3. Process data using spark

    Transforms them to create five different tables listed under `Dimension Tables and Fact Table`.
    Each table includes the right columns and data types. Duplicates are addressed where appropriate.

4. Load it back to S3

    Writes them to partitioned parquet files in table directories on S3.

    Each of the five tables are written to parquet files in a separate analytics directory on S3. Each table has its own folder within the directory.     Songs table files are partitioned by year and then artist. Time table files are partitioned by year and month. Songplays table files are               partitioned by year and month.
    

### Dimension Tables and Fact Table

**songplays** - Fact table - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- songplay_id (INT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of each user song play 
- start_time (DATE) NOT NULL: Timestamp of beggining of user activity
- user_id (INT) NOT NULL: ID of user
- level (TEXT): User level {free | paid}
- song_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of Song played
- artist_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of Artist of the song played
- session_id (INT): ID of the user Session 
- location (TEXT): User location 
- user_agent (TEXT): Agent used by user to access Sparkify platform

**users** - users in the app
- user_id (INT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of user
- first_name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Name of user
- last_name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Last Name of user
- gender (TEXT): Gender of user {M | F}
- level (TEXT): User level {free | paid}

**songs** - songs in music database
- song_id (TEXT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of Song
- title (TEXT) NOT NULL: Title of Song
- artist_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of song Artist
- year (INT): Year of song release
- duration (FLOAT) NOT NULL: Song duration in milliseconds

**artists** - artists in music database
- artist_id (TEXT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of Artist
- name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Name of Artist
- location (TEXT): Name of Artist city
- lattitude (FLOAT): Lattitude location of artist
- longitude (FLOAT): Longitude location of artist

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- start_time (DATE) PRIMARY KEY: Timestamp of row
- hour (INT): Hour associated to start_time
- day (INT): Day associated to start_time
- week (INT): Week of year associated to start_time
- month (INT): Month associated to start_time 
- year (INT): Year associated to start_time
- weekday (TEXT): Name of week day associated to start_time
